# The runner: how an instance operator runs a released engine on stored data (G64)

**Status: BUILT in datarepo 0.20.0 (2026-09-25), logs first.** Decided by the user 2026-09-24 (D28,
U12-U15); reviewed by aging as operator (their 063, DATAREPO-50), whose two notes are built in: every
artefact records the datarepo install (version plus commit or wheel sha256), and an editable install
is refused. Code: `src/datarepo/runner.py`, `src/datarepo/engines/logs.py`, catalog loading in
`catalog.select_artefacts`. Where the build differs from the proposal below, the proposal is kept as
written and the difference is listed here:

- **One artefact per searched TARGET database**, not per bundle or per set of databases. A set would
  have made two artefacts carry the same proteome rows whenever two datasets searched the proteome
  with different extra databases, and a catalog would hold them twice.
- **The contaminant database is never resolved** (our logs 018), so it has no role here.
- **`logs_manifest` is an input by role but is NOT hashed.** It is used only to check the run, and a
  reworded manifest must not re-identify an artefact (the rule: what reaches a row is hashed, and
  nothing else is).
- **The catalog key adds `gene_set_sha256`** beside `gene_set_release`, because two gene sets can
  share a release number.
- **Two derived tables** make the join usable: `dataset_databases` (every database each search read;
  `datasets` names only the proteome) and `protein_genes` (target proteins joined to their gene rows,
  with contaminants excluded).
- go and ptmQtl engines are not built. They wait on their releases. go's per-row columns are in schema
  0.0.10 as D28 decided.
- **2026-10-05: the go engine is BUILT in C# but cannot run: go has published no definition id** (charter
  S4; asked as GO-D4, our go 021). `dotnet/src/DataRepo.Runner/GoEngine.cs`, engine `go.annotate_groups`:
  mzLib 1.0.593's `GoGroupAnnotator` on one bundle's `protein_group_quant`, annotated from the bundle's
  TARGET databases only (contaminant panels are not annotation input), unknown GO ids skipped and listed
  (go D35); go's two TSVs written by mzLib's writers, read back by `Sources/Go.cs` as the acceptance check,
  kept in the artefact beside the three tables. **One artefact per bundle**, keyed on its inputs (the
  protein-group file, each target database, `ontology`, `category_map`), not the bundle id. The catalog
  (version 9) loads it into `protein_localizations` / `organelle_term_categories` / `annotation_sources`
  with the matched bundle's `dataset_id` and `bundle_id`, and a `go.annotate_groups coverage` check names
  bundles without one. `datarepo run go.annotate_groups` refuses until `GoEngine.DefinitionId` is set to
  the id go publishes; that constant is the one-line change that enables it.

## What it is for

Engines that work on **stored results** (charter §2: logs' gene resolution, go's annotation, ptmQtl's
trait fits, a consumer's own model fits) never learn which consumer they serve, so none runs itself.
The runner is the one command that runs a **released** engine on an instance's stored data and keeps
its output with a record a stranger can reproduce.

## The four rules it inherits (charter §2, aging 055 §1)

1. **Released inputs only.** An engine version is a released package (pyMzLib from PyPI, which pins a
   released mzLib), never a working tree, exactly as `ingest` refuses an unannounced ingester.
2. **Idempotent.** The same (engine, engine version, inputs) is refused as "already done", with the
   existing artefact's id.
3. **Beside the bundle, never inside it.** A search bundle is immutable and cited by id. An engine
   output is a separate, separately content-addressed **artefact**; writing one never reads, rewrites
   or re-identifies a search bundle. This is the study layer's rule (U5, `study.py`) applied again.
4. **The record is the output's provenance.** Engine, version, every input with its sha256, the
   definition id, and the runner's own version.

## Proposed shape

### Command

```
datarepo run <engine> --store <store> [--bundle <accession>=<bundle id> ...] [--input <role>=<path> ...]
```

- `<engine>` is one of a fixed list the runner knows (`logs.resolve_genes` first). Each is a small
  adapter in `datarepo/engines/<engine>.py` that names the pyMzLib verb, the inputs it needs by role,
  which stored table(s) it writes, and the engine's own acceptance checks (below).
- **Inputs by role, never by guess.** For logs: `gene_set`, `xref` (both from logs' manifest) and the
  searched database, which the runner takes **from the bundle's own record** (`search_database`,
  `search_database_sha256`) and refuses if the file on disk does not hash to it.

### Artefact

```
<store>/_engine/<engine>/<artefact id>/
    run.json              the record (below)
    <table>.parquet       one file per schema table the engine fills
```

- The leading underscore keeps it out of the dataset namespace, as `_study/` does.
- **Artefact id** = sha256 over: engine name, engine release (pyMzLib version and the mzLib version it
  reports), each input's role and sha256, the definition id, `RUNNER_VERSION`, and the schema version.
  Not the bundle id: logs resolves a **searched database**, which fifteen human datasets share, so the
  one artefact serves all of them, and re-ingesting a dataset does not re-run an unchanged resolution.
- `run.json`: the fields hashed above, plus `written_utc`, the runner's `__version__`, the bundles it
  was asked on behalf of, the verb's own summary (outcome counts, caveats), and the engine's
  acceptance result.

### Acceptance, per engine (refuse, don't guess)

| engine | checked before anything is written |
|---|---|
| logs `resolve_genes` | `xref` given (else not `logs:DEF-GENE-RESOLUTION v1`, logs 017); every row's `gene_set_sha256` and `ensembl_xref_sha256` equal logs' manifest `row_values`; zero caveats or they are recorded |
| go (after its release) | `sources/go.py`: released writer, header recount, coverage (0.18.1) |
| ptmQtl (after #1341) | defined with ptmQtl when its verb exists |

### Where the rows go

This is the one piece that needs a **schema change**, so it is taken once, with the first engine:

- **logs** has no table. Proposed: `gene_resolutions`, keyed as logs keys it: `(search_database_sha256,
  gene_set_release, accession, gene_id)`, with logs' columns as they write them and
  `definition_id`. The join to `proteins` is entry-level (LOGS-D2, our 018), and on today's corpus it
  needs no mapping (logs 019).
- **go** fills the existing `protein_localizations` / `organelle_term_categories` /
  `annotation_sources`, plus go's per-row evidence columns (n_members, n_with, propagated, inherited,
  annotation_status, q_value, protein_group), which 0.0.9 lacks.

### Catalog

`datarepo build` loads every artefact under `_engine/` whose inputs match the catalog: for logs,
whose `search_database_sha256` is the database of a bundle in the catalog. `catalog_id` then hashes
the artefact ids too, so a catalog cites exactly which resolution it serves. A catalog that would
need an artefact that does not exist builds without it and says so in `catalog_checks`, the way an
empty study layer does today.

## What it will not do

- Fetch anything. The operator supplies every input file; the runner hashes and checks it.
- Pick an engine version. It records the one installed and refuses an unreleased one.
- Run on a search bundle's behalf without the operator asking.
