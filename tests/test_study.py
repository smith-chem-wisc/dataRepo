"""The study layer: tables a consumer project adds on top of the generic core.

The rule (U5) is that a study layer ADDS tables keyed on core identifiers and never alters a core
table, so these tests are mostly about the boundary holding: the core must stay complete and usable
without the layer, and the layer must not shadow anything.

What is under test here is the SHAPE, and the shape must hold whether or not anything has filled it:
aging's benchmark distinguishes NO_TABLE from EMPTY_TABLE, and an empty table with the right columns
is the answer "this repository can hold that, and holds none". The path that fills them --
`datarepo study` and `build --study` -- is tested in `test_study_bundle.py`.
