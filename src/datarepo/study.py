"""Write a study bundle: the rows a study layer contributes, delivered separately from a search.

This is DATAREPO-20(a). `age_effects` is the output of a modelling stage that runs long after a
search — aging's stage 7 — and it is not in the folder `datarepo ingest` reads, so an age effect
cannot arrive the way a PSM does. It needed its own path, and the path had to satisfy three things
at once:

* **Delivering a model result must never force a re-ingest.** A study bundle is a separate,
  separately content-addressed object. Writing one does not read, touch or re-identify a single
  search bundle, so a re-fit cannot move the id of a bundle somebody has already cited.
* **A study layer adds tables and never alters a core one** (U5). That is true of the file layout
  here as well: the bundle holds only its layer's tables and `build` unions it in beside the core
  rather than into it.
* **The producer declares what they are handing over**, exactly as D9 makes them declare a search.
  The contract is `study.yaml`, and it is deliberately the dumbest one that works: a table per file,
  columns named as the schema names them. dataRepo does not know what shape aging's modelling stage
  writes internally and is not going to guess -- the one thing it insists on is that the rows land
  in the schema the definition was transcribed into, with the definition's rules enforced on the
  way in.

**The default is running ahead of the answer, and that is on purpose (D7).** aging has not yet
replied to thread 022, so this is the default recorded there, built so the tables can stop being
empty. Two things it deliberately does NOT decide, because they are aging's to decide and a check
here would freeze a guess into the data:

* `feature_id` at meta grain is not resolved against anything. DATAREPO-20(c) asks what a feature's
  cross-dataset identity even is, and a foreign key written before that answer would be a guess with
  the authority of a constraint.
* `definition_id` WAS unresolved against anything, and aging asked for the check with a correction
  to its target (their 024 section 2a). Their definitions are not produced by a search and have no
  business in a search bundle, so the core `definitions` table is the wrong register. A delivery
  therefore declares **its own** definitions, and a `definition_id` that is not among them refuses
  the write: a number whose definition id is unresolvable is the exact failure the register exists
  to prevent, and they would rather the write failed than the row landed.
