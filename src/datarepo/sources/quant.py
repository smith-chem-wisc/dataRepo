"""FlashLFQ's wide tables -> ProteinGroup and QuantValue rows.

FlashLFQ writes one column per run (`Intensity_<run>`, `SpectralCount_<run>`); the schema stores
quantities long, one row per (assay, feature, definition), because that is the shape that survives
TMT channels and DIA without a schema change (D5). Melting is therefore the whole job here.

Two rules from the producer side are enforced while melting. **Missing is missing**: a
`NotDetected` cell or a zero intensity produces no row at all, never a zero, because a zero would
be read downstream as a measurement of absence. And **every number carries a definition**, which is
what lets intensity and spectral count share one `value` column without ambiguity.
