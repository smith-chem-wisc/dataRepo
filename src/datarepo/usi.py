"""Mint Universal Spectrum Identifiers.

Every PSM carries a USI, which is what lets a person or an agent pull up the actual spectrum behind
a claim from PRIDE's PROXI service (FRAMEWORK section 1, lesson 5).

    mzspec:PXD036557:QE-002123_GM7_b:scan:40132:KLADQC[UNIMOD:4]TGLQ/3

The trap is the run name. A USI must name the file *as deposited in the archive*, but the search
ran on calibrated copies, so MetaMorpheus reports `QE-002123_GM7_b-calib`. Resolving that back to
the deposited name is done against the fetch manifest's own file list, not by guessing, so a run
that cannot be matched produces no USI rather than one that fails to resolve.
