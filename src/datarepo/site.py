"""Generate the public static site from a built catalog (FRAMEWORK step 4a, D16, D17).

    datarepo site <catalog.duckdb> --out <dir> [--base-url URL] [--data-url URL]

The site is a derived artefact like the catalog itself: it is written from one catalog and nothing
else, regenerating it moves no bundle id and no catalog id, and deleting it loses nothing. dataRepo
ships the generator; aging publishes the output (D8, D16). It needs no server: every page is plain
HTML that works with no API behind it, which FRAMEWORK section 5 requires.

What it writes:

* `index.html` -- every dataset in the catalog, with the catalog's id so a reader knows which data
  the numbers describe. Carries a schema.org `DataCatalog` block.
* `datasets/<id>.html` -- one page per dataset, with a Bioschemas `Dataset` block, the dataset's
  open findings, and a summary sentence.
* `llms.txt` -- the entry point for an agent (llmstxt.org), which is who this repository is for.
* `datasets.json` -- the same facts as the pages, for a program rather than a reader.
* `croissant.json` -- only with `--data-url`, because a Croissant file is a description of files
  someone can download, and without one it would describe nothing.
* `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` -- only with `--base-url`, because both need absolute URLs.

**The summary is grounded by construction (D17).** It is a template filled from catalog fields, not
prose from a model, so it may be clumsy but it cannot say anything about biology the catalog does
not hold. It is still labelled "generated", because D17 makes the label part of the contract and a
model-written summary can later replace the template without changing what the label promises.

**Nothing here is invented to fill a gap.** An absent licence is left out of the metadata and
reported, not defaulted to D3's value; an organism with no name in the catalog is shown as its
taxon id; a dataset with no title is shown under its accession. A field the catalog cannot fill is
the same failure as a `required: true` column with no true value.

        title: the site's name. Defaults to one built from the catalog's instance.
        base_url: where the site will be served. Needed for absolute URLs in the structured data,
            `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`; without it links are relative and those are skipped.
        data_url: where the bundle store is served, as `<data_url>/<dataset>/<bundle>/<table>.parquet`.
            Without it no download links are written and `croissant.json` is skipped.
        about: Markdown for the front page's overview: what the project behind this instance is
            and why it exists. It is the instance owner's text, not dataRepo's, so it comes in
            from outside rather than being written here.
        purpose: the question the instance serves, as the end of "for questions about ...", e.g.
            "how organelle proteomes change with age". The operator's words; without it no page
            claims a purpose. Shown in the tagline, the overview, `llms.txt` and the structured data.
        keywords: extra schema.org keywords for every dataset page, e.g. `aging`.
        notice: a banner shown at the top of every page and of `llms.txt`, e.g. that the site is a
            preview whose data will be regenerated. It goes where no reader, human or agent, can
            miss it, because a caveat on a page nobody opens is not a caveat.
