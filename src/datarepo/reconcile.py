"""Check the bundle's own tables against the producer's summary numbers.

Step 1's test is that counts reconcile (FRAMEWORK section 6). An ingester that silently drops a
tenth of the PSMs still writes a plausible-looking bundle, so every bundle recounts its own tables
and compares them with what MetaMorpheus's `results.txt` and the pipeline's provenance reported.

A mismatch is never fatal and never hidden: it is written into `bundle.json` and raised as a
Finding on the dataset, because some mismatches are real and already known (aging's S20 and S21)
and the repository's job is to carry them with their explanation, not to paper over them.
