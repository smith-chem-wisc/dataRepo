"""Referential checks run before a bundle is written.

Parquet has no foreign keys, so nothing stops a bundle from shipping a quantity whose feature ID
names a peptidoform that is not in the peptidoform table. An agent asking "how much of protein X is
in run Y" would simply get nothing back, and would have no way to tell a missing measurement from a
broken link.

These checks are not advisory. A dangling reference is an ingester bug, not a property of the data,
so it stops the write rather than becoming a Finding: a Finding is for something true about the
dataset, and this would be something false about the bundle.

One escape exists, and only one. A producer can write the *same* row twice -- MetaMorpheus wrote
one protein group three times in PXD027318, byte-identical in every column (aging thread 015). Two
identical rows for one identifier carry no information the one row does not, so
`collapse_exact_duplicates` drops the copies and records what it dropped. Rows that share an
identifier and differ anywhere are still refused, because then the producer is saying two different
things about one thing and someone has to decide which is true. Strict check, lossless escape.
