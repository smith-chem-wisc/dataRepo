"""`datarepo run`: an instance operator runs a RELEASED engine on stored data (G64, D27, D28).

Engines that work on stored results (logs' gene resolution first; go and ptmQtl once released) never
learn which consumer they serve, so none of them runs itself. dataRepo ships this runner and
operates nothing: the instance operator (today aging) runs it. Its output is an **engine artefact**,
content-addressed and written beside the bundles, never inside one (U12):

    <store>/_engine/<engine>/<artefact id>/
        run.json              the record: engine, releases, every input with its sha256
        <table>.parquet       one file per schema table the engine fills

The four rules it keeps (charter section 2, aging 055 section 1, design/RUNNER.md):

1. **Released inputs only.** The engine is a released package; an editable or source install is
   refused. So is an editable or unidentifiable datarepo (aging 063): an artefact stamped by
   uncommitted code is reproducible by nobody.
2. **Idempotent.** The artefact id is a sha256 over the engine, its release, every input's role and
   sha256, the definition id, `RUNNER_VERSION` and the schema version (U13). An id already on disk
   is "already done", and nothing is re-run.
3. **Beside the bundle, never inside it.** A run never reads a bundle's rows, never rewrites one and
   never moves a bundle id. It reads only a bundle's `bundle.json`, for which databases it searched.
4. **The record is the output's provenance.** `run.json` holds everything hashed plus what was not:
   the datarepo install, the bundles asked about, the engine's own summary and acceptance result.

Same boundary as `bundle.INGESTER_VERSION`: what reaches a written row is hashed, and nothing else.
The datarepo install is recorded but NOT hashed, because a runner release that writes the same rows
must not re-identify an artefact. `RUNNER_VERSION` is what moves when it would not.
